# VR-Trip
A simple Virtual Reality app built using React VR to offer a Panoramic 360 Travel Expirience.

**I strongly recommend running the app on Firefox(latest nightly build recommended) instead of Chrome for VR Support and best performance.**

## How to run the app :
* Clone this repository
* Install the dependencies inside the project folder
```
npm install
```
* Run the dev server
```
npm start
```
